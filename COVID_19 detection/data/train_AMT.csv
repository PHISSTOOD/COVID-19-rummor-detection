"@IamSumanDe Can coronavirus spread by fly, mosquito or others ?",2
"@mayuutann @MoinKhanIF Living things do evolve and change.  But for a coronavirus to become mosquito-transmitted would be an extreme change.  And nothing like that has happened before with other coronaviruses, such as SARS, MERS, the ones that cause colds, and some that cause disease in farm animals",3
"@mayuutann @MoinKhanIF Well, not zero probability of coronavirus in an infected person's blood.  But then to be transmitted by a mosquito, it still has to infect the mosquito, and it is not adapted to do so.  It is not a type of virus that infects insects, and that would be very difficult to change.",2
"@mayuutann @MoinKhanIF Also, from that paper I linked, it seems that infected humans usually don't have coronavirus in their blood anyway.  So a mosquito couldn't pick it up with blood.  The virus mostly stays in the person's lungs.",2
"@MoinKhanIF @mayuutann In order to develop the ability to infect a mosquito, this virus would have to change so much as to be a completely different type of virus; and since other coronaviruses have never been able to do that, there's no reason to think this one will.",0
"@MoinKhanIF @mayuutann See https://t.co/UxmDzD2avZ on coronavirus in blood.  Coronaviruses are only known to infect birds and mammals, and mosquito-transmitted diseases like malaria, dengue, and West Nile virus are able to actually infect the mosquito too, not just be carried by the mosquito",0
@MoinKhanIF @mayuutann I think it is not really possible for mosquitoes to transmit the novel coronavirus.  No other coronaviruses are mosquito-transmitted; it is not much present in infected persons' blood in the first place; and moquitoes only bite every 2-3 days and the virus doesn't live that long.,2
